Required Software Installation for the 2018 Season

2018 FRC supports Java JDK version 8 (1.8xx) only.  Do not update to version 9.  Latest version of java is shows as 1.8.0_152 in Eclipse.
The appropriate file to download is jdk-8u152-windows-x64.exe

Eclipse Oxygen is the latest version but wants to update previous projects so I kept with Eclipse Neon.  If there are reasons to switch we can always do it
